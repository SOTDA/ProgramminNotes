Since C# 8, default implementations can also be included in interfaces.

C# Access Modifiers
In C#, members of a class can be marked with access modifiers, including public and private. A public member can be accessed by other classes. A private member can only be accessed by code in the same class.
By default, fields, properties, and methods are private, and classes are public.

C# Field
In C#, a field stores a piece of data within an object. It acts like a variable and may have a different value for each instance of a type.
A field can have a number of modifiers, including: public, private, static, and readonly. If no access modifier is provided, a field is private by default.

C# this Keyword
In C#, the this keyword refers to the current instance of a class.

C# Members
In C#, a class contains members, which define the kind of data stored in a class and the behaviors a class can perform. 

Extension Methods
Extension methods are special static methods that can be called as if they were instance methods of an existing type.
 we can also create extention method for IEnumerable.
They are a convenient way to add new methods to an existing class without changing the original source code or inheriting from the class.
Extension methods look and behave like instance methods, but there are a few important differences to keep in mind:
Extension methods cannot access private members of the extended type.
They also do not participate in inheritance or polymorphism.
You cannot override an existing method with an extension method.
